# Introduction to Empirical Translation Process Research

This introduction to the **CRITT TPR-DB** and to empirical TPR consists of **12 sessions** that were recorded during a [Summer Course 2023](https://sites.google.com/site/centretranslationinnovation/conferences-workshops/tpr-course-2023?authuser=0) at Saarland University, Germany.

In the schedule of this course below:

- Sessions with a **green background** introduce data acquisition and visualization tools.
- Sessions with a **red/blue background** address topics in data analysis, data interpretation, and/or theoretical considerations.
